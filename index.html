								<h2 class="major">Interest In IT</h2>
								<p>My interest is all about data, databases and database management system. The seed of interest in this kind of things was implanted in my early childhood.<br>As my father is from technical background, in my childhood itself my father used to tell me interesting things related to tech such as mobile phones, web browsing and much more. All these things fascinated me and gradually I started taking interest in all that. There was an exponential growth of my interest in information technology when I was 11 years old and attended a workshop related to how tech giants work, how they earn profit, how they collect our data such as personal information, banking details and much more . In higher classes too I opted for computer science as an optional subject to know more and more about different software. Furthermore, in lockdown amid covid pandemic, I applied for a course which taught basics of programming in python.<br>After completion of my higher secondary education, I decided to study outside my home country and continue my further education in Australia. So, I started looking for universities in Australia and during my research I came to know about RMIT. RMIT have lots of positive reviews on the internet and it is one the most globally reputed university. Also, RMIT has numerous student centric facilities which also attracted me apart from supremely skilled professors who are always ready to help students.<br>
									<br>During my studies, I expect to learn a complete computer language that is python which would help me in my professional career. Also, with my enrolled subjects I would expect to learn to create intricate software which would finally enhance end user experience. In addition to that, during my learning, there would be drastic improvement in my communication skills with help of group assignments.</p>

								<h2>Learning Styles Test</h2>
								<p><img src="learning.jpg" width="550px"></p>
								<p>According to this test, my learning style is <i>VISUAL</i> type.</p>
								<h2>Leadership Styles Test</h2>
								<p>According to this this test, my leadership style is <i>Metamodern Leader</i></p>
								<hr>
								<p>I think these tests mean a lot to me. According to me, they define almost everything about me as they question about each and every aspect of my thinking and characteristics. In addition to that, these tests give ma a motivation to improve upon my cons and polish my pros. So, according to learning styles tests, I have good control over my visual learning, but I need to improvise my auditary and tactile learning type. As per Myer-Briggs test, I am expert in giving guidance and advices; also I believe in bringing communities and families together. So I should make sure that I do not go wrong with my decisions and advices through out my career. Also, according to leadership test; I am a pragmatic kind of leader. I take decisions in a practical manner and I believe in development and upliftment of myself and my team. </p>
								<hr>
								<p>Talking about effects of these tests on my behaviour, there would not be any change in my behaviour; definately I would try to improve my self everyday. My behaviour is completely shaped by thinking, morals and ethics. I prefer to do everything in a practical as well as logical manner. </p>
								<hr>
								<p>If I am told to form a team at any point of time, then I would gather people according to these test results. For an instance, according to learning styles test, I lack at auditary and tactile learning, so I would make sure that I include those people who are good at the aspects where I lack and I should constantly grab knowledge from them. In addition to that, as 16 personalities test result suggests, I am very inflexible and stubborn and most often I am reluctant to trust an opinion for long. Also, being judgmental I ignore the possibility that there can be two right ways to get things done. So, during formation of my team, I should make sure this do not hinder my decision of selecting people and I should ensure that I hire team mates those who can question and correct me whenever and wherever I go wrong.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<h2>Overview:-</h2>
								<p>My It project is developing an app. This app will be solely developed and designed for student that will be highly salutary for them. This app will function in many ways; the foremost function of this app will be to relieve students from academic pressure through concerned specialists. In addition to that, there would tips and strategies that would help them to excel in their academics according to user feedback. Also, this app would help students to maintain their physical as well as mental health. There would be a section in which pupils will be given financial guidance and career advise after a certain age. To sum up, it would be a complete package for the students.</p>
								<hr>
								<h2>Motivation:-</h2>
								<p>Once I read the news about student suicide rate due to academic pressure and exam fear. The news article by a national newspaper Times of India boasted about obnoxious number of suicides among students which was around 1.39 lakh in year 2017(Link to this article:<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/one-every-hour-at-10335-last-year-saw-most-student-suicides-in-25-years/articleshow/77969096.cms">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/one-every-hour-at-10335-last-year-saw-most-student-suicides-in-25-years/articleshow/77969096.cms</a>). Not only India, in England 63 out of 145 suicides among below 20 years of age faced the academic pressure pre, during and post exam period(Link to the analysis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/13/suicides-by-young-people-peak-in-exam-season-report-findshttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/13/suicides-by-young-people-peak-in-exam-season-report-finds">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/13/suicides-by-young-people-peak-in-exam-season-report-finds</a> ). Also, as per WHO suicide due to mental health, anxiety, depression is third major cause of death of people of age group between 15-19 years(<a href="https://www.who.int/activities/Improving-the-mental-and-brain-health-of-children-and-adolescents">https://www.who.int/activities/Improving-the-mental-and-brain-health-of-children-and-adolescents</a> ). Therefore, it was an urgent call to be taken for this heart-breaking matter.
								<hr>
								<h3>Description:-</h3>
								<p>-> <b>Mental health and psychiatric assistance</b><br>-> <b>Library and Reference books</b><br>-> <b>Timetabling and grade tracker</b><br>-><b> Study and personal tutor facilities</b><br>-> <b>News and facts</b><br>-> <b>Homework aid</b><br>-> <b>Financial advises </b></p>
								<p>As per I mentioned earlier, this a student centric app so there would be very simple user interface and would be available in multiple languages. First of all, the biggest feature of the app will be to connect the user with a certified psychiatrist virtually. Users will be able to book, cancel or reschedule the appointments with professionals. In addition to that, in case of medications required, the prescription and the nearest pharmacy would be available on dashboard of the app. This feature can be used by both, studying as well as non-studying adolescents. </p>
								<p>The second would be for students exclusively. This will help them to access books, guides, digests on the device itself or will be suggesting nearby bookstore or library.</p>
								<p>In addition to that, students will get suggestion for their daily routine(timetable) for their studies which they can follow. The timetable will include study hours and free hours for physical activities. The timetable will reconfigure itself after the user feedback; for example, as per the exam results a pupil scores less in physics, so there will be alteration in timetable which will allocate more time in physics. By this a tutee can track his/her grades on a regular basis.</p>
								<p> In addition to that, individual tutors (those teachers who can conduct classes of individual students) can register themselves on this app and users will be able to find them this app itself. By this, now no student has to go from pillar to post in search of personal educators. Also, there would be a section in which there will be news updates and interesting facts from all over the world which can be also received through notifications. In addition to that, there would be specific subject wise app suggestion which would be helpful for that particular subject. For example, users would get suggestions for apps such as ‘Microsoft Maths Solver’ in which we can scan the questions to get answers. This would help a student in doing homework.</p>
								<p>Finally, the last major feature of application which provides students financial consultations. In this section, users will get recommendation different ways of earning money. For instance, suggestions such as investment in stocks, free lancing and many more will be given. In case of stocks, there would be directions for YouTube channels and apps such as ‘Groww’, ‘Apple Stocks’ which teaches to earn money by investing into stocks. Also, different freelancing ideas.</p>

								<p>To conclude, we can say that this will be full package to aid students with a supremely simple layout.</p>
								<hr>
								<h2>Skills Required:-</h2>
								<p>There are merely 3-4 skills required for the apps. which are:-</p>
								<p><b>Application developers:</b> Developers who are specialised in Python language will be designing the app as python is the platforms on which many other apps for android and iOS are developed such as ‘Spotify’, ‘Instagram’ and many more.<br><b>Application Designer:</b> They will be creating one of the finest end user experience which will enable the seamless usage of app without any hassle.<br><b>Certified Psychiatrists:</b> They will be the most crucial people for app to run. Finding them would be difficult. They will be providing an aid for mental health issues.<br>There is no specific hardware required for this project other than desktops or laptops in which programming would be done.<br>Some entry level and 1 experienced application developers and designers would be required which could be tough process to find them.</p>
								<hr>
								<h2>Outcomes:-</h2>
								<p>If my project would be successful and will be designed as per the plan then, it would not solve the original problem of ill mental health of adolescents and students as a whole but if it would contribute to reduce a fraction of this problem then also it would be grand success of this project. More and more usage of this app will assist students to get rid of academic stress and eventually create interest in primary education. In addition to that, this will help in reducing student dropout rate from secondary and higher secondary schooling.</p>
